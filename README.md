## Command-Line Time Tracker ðŸ’»
 ### A simple bash shell script that creates a title, start, and end time for a task. Ouput has been redirected to a file.
 
 #### Here's how to use it:
 ```
 ./time-tracker.sh --start
# this will prompt you to enter in a title for your current task and automatically collects the current
# timestamp

./time-tracker.sh --end
# this will automatically collect the timestamp for when you've finished a task
```
#### A few things to note about this:
  - This is nothing crazy, just fun simple project I wanted to try
  - I haven't thoroughly tested this or included any error handling
  - I've never written anything in Bash before so please take the styling with a grain of salt (please)
  - Feel free to make any changes to it! I plan on adding more features in the future, but who knows when that will be :)
